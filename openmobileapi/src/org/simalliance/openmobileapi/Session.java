     * used. If the AID is defined then the corresponding Applet is selected.
     * Once this channel has been opened by a device application, it is considered as "locked" by this device
     * application, and other calls to this method will return null, until the channel is closed. Some Secure
     * Elements (like the UICC) might always keep the basic channel locked (i.e. return null to applications),
     * to prevent access to the basic channel, while some other might return a channel object implementing
     * some kind of filtering on the commands, restricting the set of accepted command to a smaller set.
     * It is recommended for the UICC to reject the opening of the basic channel to a specific Applet, by
     * always answering null to such a request.
     * For other Secure Elements, the recommendation is to accept opening the basic channel on the default
     * Applet until another Applet is selected on the basic channel. As there is no other way than a reset to
     * select again the default Applet, the implementation of the transport API should guarantee that the
     * openBasicChannel(null) command will return null until a reset occurs. If such a restriction is not
     * possible, then openBasicChannel(null) should always return null and therefore prevent access to the
     * default Applet on the basic channel.
